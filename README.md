# XOR Decryption: Partial Known Plaintext Attack

## Overview
This project decrypts an XOR-encrypted ZIP file (`encrypted.zip.hex`) using a known-plaintext attack. The file was encrypted with an 80-bit XOR key. By leveraging the known structure of a ZIP file header, we can recover the encryption key and decrypt the entire file.

## Approach
### XOR Decryption with Known Plaintext
- The key is derived by XORing the first 10 bytes of the ciphertext with the known ZIP file header.
- The key is then used iteratively to decrypt the rest of the file.

### ZIP Header Structure
The known structure of a ZIP file's first 10 bytes:
- **Signature**: `50 4B 03 04`
- **Version**: `14 00`
- **Flags**: `00 00`
- **Compression**: `08 00`

Using this information, the key is derived and then applied to the entire file to recover the original data.

## Files
- `xor_decrypt.py`: The Python script that performs the decryption.
- `XOR.key`: The derived XOR key (automatically generated by the script).
- `decrypted.zip`: The resulting decrypted ZIP file (output).

## Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- The `bitarray` module (if using the bit-oriented version of the script): Install it using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install bitarray
